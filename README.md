##FAQ

_Why are some tests skipped?_

I'm testing my tests using the wonderful [babel](http://babeljs.io/) transpiler. There ES6 coverage is excellent [but not yet 100%](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/#babel). I'm skipping the tests that aren't yet covered so that Travis stays green. 

I'm certainly not trying to compete with the great work of _test262_. This is purely to improve my own understanding of the ES6 spec–and I figure writing tests from scratch (with no cribbing) is the best way to achieve that.


_There's already an [excellent ES test suite](https://github.com/tc39/test262) Why bother writing another?_

_Can I contribute?_

I welcome issues (I'm sure there are plenty of errors, and I don't have time to be particularly thorough). However I'm not accepting PRs for entire test modules, since I'm doing this for my own education (see above)
